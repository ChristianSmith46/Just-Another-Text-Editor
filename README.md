# Just-Another-Text-Editor

## Description
In this module the goal was to create a Progressive Web Application for a text editor using webpack.  The javascript files should be bundled, served using webpack, include a service worker, and include a generated manifest file.  The app stores the text editors data with IndexedDb and static assets are pre cached.  The application can be installed as a desktop application from the website.
